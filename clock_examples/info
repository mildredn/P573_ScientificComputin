This directory shows a simple timer wrapper function and a sample main program that
calls it, in C, C++, and Fortran. The C++ version calls a high-resolution clock if
it is available; otherwise you're pointed to use gettimeofday(), which is available
with any C distribution, but not always of good precision. In Linux available timers
include time() [the function time(), not the command time], rtc, hwclock,
gettimeofday, times, and getrusage.

The wrapper function is named elapsedtime(), and it returns a double precision
number giving the number of seconds since some event (start of the program, last
reboot, 1 January 1970, my birthday, whatever). So as the name suggests, it is an
elapsed timer, not a delta timer.

The Fortran one has three options in the elapsedtime() function, but all three are
specified by the language standard and so should be available with any
standards-compliant compiler. It assumes Fortran 2008 is used. 

The C version has five options, and must not be used without first reading all of
the comments in the file - it cannot be used blindly.
